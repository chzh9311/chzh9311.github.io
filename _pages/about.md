I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science in University of Birmingham, UK. I am supervised by Prof. [Hyung Jin Chang](https://hyungjinchang.wordpress.com/) and Prof. [Ale&scaron; Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/). Before my Ph.D., I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Xu Zhao](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/Xu), and was a member of [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.sjtu.edu.cn).
